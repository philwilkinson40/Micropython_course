Micropython MeetUp Workshop
All, we will take off where we finished in the intro workshop.  
Lets finish helping Shenton Dogs Home with their kennel hot weather management system.  

New Micropython stuff 
-Interrupt Service Routines. Timer Interrupts

New Hardware Ideas
-daisy chain up multiple sensors on the i2c bus


The use case is a cost-effective temperature and humidity monitoring/logging IOT system.

User Requirements; the system shall...
1) alert nearby workers when a particular kennel temp is too high
2) alarm nearby workers when a kennel temp and humidity is high
3) provide office workers with temperature and humidity readings; updated every 3 mins
4) provide audible and visual alerts in office when any kennel temp is high
5) log temperature and humidity readings into a file. Low memory, easy to extract, not likely to become obselete, etc,etc
6) facilitate remote alerts if temp/humidity rises out of office hours

don't forget
A) use config files to minimise/simplify future modifications (e.g. 'high' temp/humidity levels)
B) office-based functionality can utilise microcontrollers using Micropython or old computers running  CPython 
C) paho-mqtt library for C Python
